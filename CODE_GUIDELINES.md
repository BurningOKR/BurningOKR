# Code Guidelines
##General
###Tests
All future code contributed has to be covered by unit tests.

### Commit Messages
We try to structure our commit messages according to [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

The recommend the [conventional commit plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit) for IntelliJ.

## Frontend
### TS-Lint
This project uses [ts-lint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) to enforce most of the code guidelines. You have to follow these rules in order to contribute.
We recommend using a tslint plugin for your IDE. Intellij comes prebundled with a tslint plugin.

If your IDE does not support ts-lint, use the command ``ng lint`` to find any ts-lint errors.

### Definitions

- Type definition: a type definition looks like this: ``export type ExampleType = string;``

### General Code Guidelines
We will only cover code guidelines, which are not enforced by ts-lint here:

| üëçDo | üëéDon't |
|----|-------|
|Use [Angular I18n](https://angular.io/guide/i18n) to display strings or messages to the user.               | Display any string without Internationalization.|
| Try to avoid using the ``any`` type. Use generics or explicit types instead.                               | Use the ``any`` type, when you know the explicit type of the object. |
| Always use explicit types and define new types if necessary                                                | Use anonymous objects |
| Use short types and create type definitions when a type becomes to long.                                   | Use types, that are larger than the identifier and it's type parameters. |
| Add new type definitions to the typings.d.ts file, when they are globally used.                            | Put new global type definitions anywhere else but the typings.d.ts file. |
| Add component scoped or service scoped type definitions in the same file, as the class that depends on it. | Add component scoped or service scoped type definitions in the typings.d.ts file. |

### Architecture
If your component or service is used in...
- ... every module, declare it in the core module.
- ... some modules, declare it in the shared module.
- ... one module, declare it in this module.

## Backend
### Spotless
We use [Spottless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/master/plugin-gradle/README.md) to apply the [Google Java Styling](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) guidelines.

We can only accept pull requests if Spotless can't find any formatting errors. So please make sure to run ```spotlessApply``` before commiting.
