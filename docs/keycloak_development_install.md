## Overview

Welcome to the Keycloak Readme!
This document provides a high-level overview of Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution developed by Red Hat. Keycloak simplifies the process of securing applications and services by offering a centralized authentication and authorization platform.

## What is Keycloak?

Keycloak is a robust and extensible Identity and Access Management (IAM) system that helps organizations manage user identities, authentication, and authorization in a secure and user-friendly manner. It serves as a comprehensive solution for handling user authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and authorization, enabling developers to focus on building applications while delegating user management concerns to Keycloak.

## Getting started

To start using Keycloak, follow the official documentation which is provided from Keycloak: <https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker>

1. Make sure to name the created realm `burning-okr`
2. To manage the realm, create a Realm Role and the name must be `burning-okr-admin`

By following all necessary steps from the official documentation, you now have Keycloak set up.
